# showme

This repo contains a reimplementation in Clojure of the `showme` program from [Triangle](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) for visualization of triangular meshes and Voronoi diagrams.
This project is to teach myself how to use [quil](http://quil.info/) to draw things and do interactive stuff.


## Usage

`lein run -m showme.core <filename>.poly`
